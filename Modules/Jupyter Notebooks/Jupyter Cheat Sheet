%run -- allows you to run an external Python script. Any variables in the script will be stored in the current kernel session.
%edit -- opens a file editor. Any code you type into the editor will be executed by Jupyter when you exit the editor.
%debug -- if there's an error in any of your code, running %debug afterwards will open an interactive debugger you can use to trace the error.
%history -- shows you the last few commands you ran.
%save -- saves the last few commands you ran to a file.
%who -- print all the variables in the session.
%reset -- resets the session, and removes all stored variables.

%cpaste -- opens a special editing area where you can paste in code normally, without whitespace being a problem. You can type -- alone on a line to exit. After you exit, any code you pasted in will be immediately executed.
%paste -- takes code from your clipboard and runs it in Jupyter. This doesn't work on remote systems, where Jupyter doesn't have access to your clipboard.
